Matts Ideas:
-I think each garden can only have one specific gardener and plant
    -specific gardeners can have more than one garden
-Create a function for a gardener to add a garden of a certain plant
-Implement the quantity for the plants in a garden
-Maybe add a counter that increments on plants so we can harvest ready plants
-If gardener has gardens already, show the gardens they currently have
-Show which gardens have specific plants

-if existing gardener logs in, show menu:
    -show all gardens
    -show their garden/s
        -plant in their garden
    -visit another garden
        -if they have the xp required, become a gardener in that garden and plant
-if new gardener, show menu:
    -if in existing city
        -show garden/s in their city
            -if they have xp required, plant in garden/become gardener in that garden
    -if in new city
        -travel to an existing garden(view_gardens)
            -if they have the xp required, become a gardener in that garden and plant
        -create a new garden
            -plant a plant they have xp required for in their garden
            -plant a new plant
