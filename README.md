Matts Ideas:
-I think each garden can only have one specific gardener and plant
    -specific gardeners can have more than one garden
-Create a function for a gardener to add a garden of a certain plant
-Implement the quantity for the plants in a garden
-Maybe add a counter that increments on plants so we can harvest ready plants
-If gardener has gardens already, show the gardens they currently have
-Show which gardens have specific plants
